Through this approach- our students develop a remarkable balance between mind and heart. We aspire to develop ethical citizens committed to building a just and caring world. Ethos school decided not to import ready-made foreign programs- but rather to develop its own character education program flavored with our local traditions and culture. The main objective of this program is to foster strong and independent students of character who know right from wrong- have self confidence- trust their capabilities- and who are moral agents by internalizing how one thinks and feels influences one's actions. Furthermore- it is important to Ethos School to create a differentiated environment where students feel safe and secure- both physically and emotionally.",

The past decade in particular has seen the company flourish as the countries of the Arab world began to liberalize their economies- opening doors for private sector investments in strategic sectors that had once been off limits. Our portfolio of companies currently employs over 4-000 people and has the potential for ongoing job creation as companies and investments mature. As long-term investors- we take pride in growing the businesses in which we invest and positively contributing to the economic growth of the region. EKH has deployed its resources in a manner that has largely shielded the company from the full impact of the social and economic upheaval that has characterized its operating environment during the past five years. The company\u2019s ability to drive revenue growth and margin expansion across its investment portfolio is a testament to the resilience of its strategy and the dedication of its management teams.",
